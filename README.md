This is a program which tracks your finances and gives you feedback about your expenses etc.

I'm working on translating the whole program into english. It is highly work in progress - there's a lot still to be added.
To run it go into the main method, the rest is self explanatory

If you have any tips let me know!

- Release 1.0

- translated the code into english
- added support for categories
- added automatic date tracking
- added quarter view for expenses
